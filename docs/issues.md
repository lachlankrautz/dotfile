# Issues

- tries to link file inside linked dir (.docker (osx), .docker/config.json (shared)) tries to do both
- bad error message on import inside already linked dir
- poor visibility on status dir vs file
- unclear if relative paths required from cwd or home

# Features

- show diff on required backup+link
- autocomplete commands (zsh/bash)
- export unlink and return file
- repo (sync) automate git config commands
